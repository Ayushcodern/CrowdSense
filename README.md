# 🚀 CROWDSENSE

**CROWDSENSE** is a MongoDB-powered web application built during a hack day to improve how urgent public issues are reported, categorized, and resolved.

The goal is simple:  
**sense problems early, prioritize them correctly, and fix them transparently.**

## 🧠 What is CROWDSENSE?

CROWDSENSE is designed to **collect real-time data about nearby urgent issues**—such as infrastructure problems, safety concerns, or civic complaints—and **categorize them based on urgency levels**.

Administrators can then:
- Quickly identify critical issues
- Prioritize responses efficiently
- Track actions transparently

This creates a feedback loop where problems don’t just get reported—they get resolved.
